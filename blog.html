					<p>To begin with (and probably for a long time after) I am
expecting this blog to be rather empty. It would probably be a good idea to put
topics into it even if the website isn't finished, as then it won't just be empty.
 I am not really sure how these images have chosen their locations, I also need
a way of limiting the size, so that I don't have to keep making all the images I
 add the same dimensions.</p>
					<div class="image round right">
						<img src="images/api.png" alt="Pic 02" />
					</div>
					<p>These topics can be rather generic, maybe over time I can
 start catergorizing them so there are coding ones/ music and so forth. But that
 won't be a focus until either the website is done or the sheer number of blogs
I have written has surpassed a crazy number. 10 for example. Obviously a lot of
this rambling is unnecessary, but I am kind of using it to get an idea of how
much text is needed in order to not make the blog 'posts' look tiny.</p>
					<p>Hopefully I can get back into mathematics and electronics
 and use this blog as a record of my progress and improvement as well as
encouragement to continue learning new things.</p>
